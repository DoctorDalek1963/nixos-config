- Wezterms now render all text as block chars
- (Maybe?) SafeEyes doesn't recognise AppIndicator but snixembed creates a duplicate icon so SafeEyes is using AppIndicator despite complaining about it
- I need to update my Thanatophobia fork to GNOME 47
- Try Wayland again
- Cursors are always light (and wrong shape)

- Unbind Wezterm hotkeys for things I never use (panes etc.)
- Font is thicker in GNOME 47 lock screen (nitpick)
